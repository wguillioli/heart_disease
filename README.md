# Predicting Heart Disease
Unfortunately, cardiovascular diseases are the world's most common cause of death. The motivation of this project is to understand if we can predict the presence or absence of heart disease in people given basic medical information. This is a very personal project for me due to the disease history in my family - including my father.  

The data is provided courtesy of the [Cleveland Heart Disease Database](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/145/statlog+heart) via the UCI Machine Learning repository.
